## Tips
- You can find some trainer at [Fling](https://flingtrainer.com/).
- If you are unable to click on the selected cheat, please switch to windowed mode in the game settings.
- Use the language setting if your game or cheat language  not correct (most on non-steam games).
- DXVK ASYNC is a ProtonGE hack to skip shader compilation stutter by not waiting for shaders to compile, which could avoids the stutter (Maybe GPL?).
